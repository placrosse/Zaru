    /// can be derived from the tensor shape *before* it goes through these nodes.

    /// Example: `face_detection_short_range` has a `1×6×8×8` and a `1×2×16×16` tensor produced by
    /// `Conv` nodes, which then go through `Transpose`, `Reshape`, and `Concat` before being output

    /// first, then the `1×6×8×8` data. Therefore, the anchors can be computed from two
