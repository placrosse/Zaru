    // In case of negatives, flip all the bits except the sign
    // to achieve a similar layout as two's complement integers
    //
    // Why does this work? IEEE 754 floats consist of three fields:
    // Sign bit, exponent and mantissa. The set of exponent and mantissa
    // fields as a whole have the property that their bitwise order is
    // equal to the numeric magnitude where the magnitude is defined.
    // The magnitude is not normally defined on NaN values, but
    // IEEE 754 totalOrder defines the NaN values also to follow the
    // bitwise order. This leads to order explained in the doc comment.
    // However, the representation of magnitude is the same for negative
    // and positive numbers â€“ only the sign bit is different.
    // To easily compare the floats as signed integers, we need to
    // flip the exponent and mantissa bits in case of negative numbers.
    // We effectively convert the numbers to "two's complement" form.
    //
    // To do the flipping, we construct a mask and XOR against it.
    // We branchlessly calculate an "all-ones except for the sign bit"
    // mask from negative-signed values: right shifting sign-extends
    // the integer, so we "fill" the mask with sign bits, and then
    // convert to unsigned to push one more zero bit.
    // On positive values, the mask is all zeros, so it's a no-op.
