//! Data filtering, averaging and smoothing.
//!
//! This module provides a generic interface for data filtering algorithms, as well as several
//! filter implementations.
//!
//! # Filter Parameters and State
//!
//! The filter interface splits filters into *parameters* and *state*. Filter *parameters* tune the
//! filter's behavior, are independent of the filtered data, are typically constant over the
//! lifetime of a filter, and can be applied to any number of filtered variables. Filter *state*
//! changes based on the filtered data, is specific to a filtered variable, and has a non-tunable
//! default value.
//!
//! This split allows using a single set of parameters to filter a large number of variables,
//! without duplicating the parameters for each one. For convenience, [`SimpleFilter`] can be used
//! to manage filter state when only a single variable is being filtered (or when parameter
//! duplication just doesn't matter much).
//!
//! # Time-based filtering
//!
//! Some filtering algorithms are explicitly designed to account for the time between measurements,
//! while some aren't. Algorithms that aren't will implement [`Filter`], while those that are will
//! implement [`TimeBasedFilter`].
//!
//! The interface of [`TimeBasedFilter`] takes the time since the previous measurement as an
//! argument. This allows users to pass custom time deltas for unit testing, data replay and other
//! use cases. In the common case where the real world time should be used, [`TimedFilterAdapter`]
//! can be used to adapt a [`TimeBasedFilter`] to the [`Filter`] trait.
