//! Zaru Machine Perception library.
//!
//! # 3D Coordinates
//!
//! For 3D coordinates, Zaru uses the coordinate system from WebGPU, wgpu, Direct3D, and Metal
//! (unless otherwise noted): X points to the right, Y points up, Z points from the camera into the
//! scene.
//!
//! One notable exceptions to this are neural networks outputting 3D coordinates â€“ depending on the
//! network, they might use X and Y coordinates from the input image, so Y will point *down*.
//!
//! # Environment Variables
//!
//! Some parts of Zaru can be overridden by setting environment variables:
//!
//! * `ZARU_JPEG_BACKEND`: Configures the JPEG image decoder to use. Allowed values are:
//!   * `mozjpeg`: uses the [mozjpeg] library to decode JPEG images.
//!   * `zune-jpeg`: uses the [zune-jpeg] crate to decode JPEG images.
//!   * `fast-but-wrong`: uses a specific patched revision of the [zune-jpeg] crate, which can
//!     perform better than mozjpeg, but incorrectly decodes (or fails to decode) some images.
//!   * `jpeg-decoder`: uses the [jpeg-decoder] crate.
//! * `ZARU_WEBCAM_NAME`: Forces the device to use for [`Webcam`]s created without an explicit
//!   device name. If unset, the first device that supports a compatible image format will be used.
