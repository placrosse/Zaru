- unify webcams, IP cameras, and animations behind a single video streaming interface
- "smart" MJPG decoding with backpressure
  - use a `WorkerSet` for decoding
  - if the `t_dequeue` time is near zero, we're bottlenecked on decoding or on the consumer
- split crate to reduce build time
  - zaru-image
  - zaru-nn (CNN stuff needs zaru-image dep)
  - zaru-cnn?
  - zaru-filter
  - zaru-video for animations, webcam and IP cam access?
  - zaru-vision for landmarks, detections, and the MediaPipe solution ports?
- rewrite the "UI" to be more fully featured
  - having an interactive thing that lets you configure any video/image source
    and apply tools to it would also be cool
- fix the compile times
  - long `cargo check` times seem to be caused by all the mediapipe soln ports, presumably because
    they include megabytes of data into the binary?
  - Rust 1.67.0 will ship an improvement for this
- port body landmarks to the new infra
