- unify webcams, IP cameras, and animations behind a single video streaming interface
  - allow creation of a video stream using a unified syntax (URI?), port all examples over
- "smart" MJPG decoding with backpressure
  - use a `WorkerSet` for decoding
  - if the `t_dequeue` time is near zero, we're bottlenecked on decoding or on the consumer
- rewrite the "UI" to be more fully featured
  - having an interactive thing that lets you configure any video/image source
    and apply tools to it would also be cool
- replace the fast-but-wrong JPEG decoder with something less awful
- `Detection` having an angle is weird, maybe the wrapper approach of landmark networks could be used instead?
