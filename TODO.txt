- unify webcams, IP cameras, and animations behind a single video streaming interface
  - allow creation of a video stream using a unified syntax (URI?), port all examples over
- "smart" MJPG decoding with backpressure
  - use a `WorkerSet` for decoding
  - if the `t_dequeue` time is near zero, we're bottlenecked on decoding or on the consumer
- rewrite the "UI" to be more fully featured
  - having an interactive thing that lets you configure any video/image source
    and apply tools to it would also be cool
- replace the fast-but-wrong JPEG decoder with something less awful
- `Detection` having an angle is weird, maybe the wrapper approach of landmark networks could be used instead?
- generalize `HandTracker` to allow tracking any type of object with a detector and landmarker network
- new MediaPipe models use f16 weights, but ONNX conversion discards this, which blows up file sizes
  - wonnx/tract/onnxruntime-rs don't seem to support f16 weights well right now
- GPU-backed `Image`
  - how to handle the 256 Byte row alignment requirement on buffer<->texture copies
  - what to replace the `draw::text` impl with?
- figure out a way to make the `ImageView` to `Tensor` conversion always built with optimizations
